Bot to automatically like your friends Instagram posts and notify you on your Slack channel.

How does it work?

This script runs Instagram API every 15mins and checks for any new Instagram post for a paticular user_id. If a new a post is found it likes the post and sends a notification to your configured Slack channel using Slack Webhooks.
