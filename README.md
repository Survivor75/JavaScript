### Interesting-People-On-Medium
Medium has a large amount of content, a large number of users, and an almost overwhelming number of posts. When you try to find interesting users to interact with, you’re flooded with visual noise.

An interesting user is someone who is from your network, who is active, and who writes responses that are generally appreciated by the Medium community.

How to do it ?

1. Get all the users from “Followings” list
2. Get the latest posts of each user
3. Get all the responses to each post
4. Filter out responses that are older than 30 days
5. Filter out responses that have less than a minimum number of recommendations
6. Get the username of the author of each response
