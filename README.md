### _what_a_platform
The game is roughly based on Dark Blue by Thomas Palef. I chose that game because it is both entertaining and minimalist. It looks like this (Level 1):

The dark box represents the player, whose task is to collect the yellow boxes (coins) while avoiding the red stuff (lava). A level is completed when all coins have been collected.

The player can walk around with the left and right arrow keys and can jump with the up arrow. Jumping is a specialty of this game character. It can reach several times its own height and can change direction in midair. This may not be entirely realistic, but it helps give the player the feeling of being in direct control of the on-screen avatar.

As of now it has 3 levels
Level 2

### Interesting-People-On-Medium
Medium has a large amount of content, a large number of users, and an almost overwhelming number of posts. When you try to find interesting users to interact with, you’re flooded with visual noise.

An interesting user is someone who is from your network, who is active, and who writes responses that are generally appreciated by the Medium community.

How to do it ?

1. Get all the users from “Followings” list
2. Get the latest posts of each user
3. Get all the responses to each post
4. Filter out responses that are older than 30 days
5. Filter out responses that have less than a minimum number of recommendations
6. Get the username of the author of each response

### UnsplashScraper
Ingredients for a simple Image Scraper

1. Python (3.6.3 or newer)

3. pip install requests Pillow selenium
4. geckodriver 
5. Mozlla Firefox (as if you didn’t have it installed)
6. Working internet connection (obviously)
7. 30 minutes of your time (possibly less)
